## Class Add for Virginia Tech

This script is heavily inspired from: [course-add.rb](https://github.com/mil/virginia-tech-hacks/blob/master/course-add.rb)

## What is This?

This is a python script for command line usage.  It will (soon) be able to

- Search for a class by the CRN number
- Search for classes by using the Course and Subject code
- Store this information in a text file for later usage

## Goals

I wanted to create my own version that:

- Had more documentation
- Was easier to setup
- Included a few additional features
- And was written in Python

## Getting Started

You'll need the following installed

- Python 2.7.X where X can be any number
- mechanize
- requests

TODO - Add Instructions for Installing

## Usage

python main_program.py

TODO - Add Instructions for Running Program

## Testing [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jason-riddle/VT-Python-Class-Add.png)](https://travis-ci.org/jason-riddle/VT-Python-Class-Add)

I test my code with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) and [behave](http://pythonhosted.org/behave/).

## PEP8 Style Guide [![codeq](https://codeq.io/github/jason-riddle/VT-Python-Class-Add/badges/testing.png)](https://codeq.io/github/jason-riddle/VT-Python-Class-Add/branches/testing)

I am using [codeq](http://codeq.io/) to help me conform to the [pep8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) standard.
